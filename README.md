## ðŸ§¬ Overview

**EasyCurling** is a standalone tool that helps chemists and materials scientists **replicate and spatially curl structures**, including molecular fragments or crystal cells, into ring-like or tubular configurations. It supports both **rigid transformations** and **flexible (progressive) curling**, allowing for easy modeling of **nanorings, nanotubes, or supramolecular macrocycles**.

Originally designed to streamline the creation of curved nanostructures in computational chemistry projects, EasyCurling is now packaged as a lightweight `.exe` with interactive input and flexible customization.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Supports both rigid and flexible curling**  
- **Handles repeated units with optional deletion of duplicate atoms**
- **Command-line interface with user-friendly prompts**
- **Iterative mode**: Easily try different repeat numbers without restarting
- **Works on molecular or crystal structures (`.xyz`)**
- **Outputs standard `.xyz` files** ready for visualization or further modeling
- **No Python environment required** (for `.exe` users)
